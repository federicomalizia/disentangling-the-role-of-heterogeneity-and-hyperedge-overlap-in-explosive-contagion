    "## Extracting and Cleaning Contact Data for Higher-Order Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the datasets discussed earlier, an important class of higher-order networks arises from **proximity and face-to-face contact data**. These systems are often collected via RFID sensors or Bluetooth-based technologies and record **timestamped pairwise interactions** between individuals. Unlike explicitly defined group datasets (e.g., emails or biochemical compounds), constructing hypergraphs from contact data requires careful methodological choices to infer **group interactions** and higher-order structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical workflow to extract a higher-order representation from contact data involves two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporal aggregation:**  \n",
    "   Interactions are aggregated over a fixed-length time window \\( $\\Delta t$ \\). For each interval \\($[t, t + \\Delta t]$\\), a snapshot \\($ W(t)$ \\) is created, encoding all pairwise interactions within that window.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clique-based hyperedge construction:**  \n",
    "   Within each snapshot \\($ W(t) $\\), maximal cliques are identified and used to construct **hyperedges** that represent higher-order co-presence among individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To focus on the most significant interactions, we assign to each hyperedge \\($ E_i $\\) a **weight** \\( $\\Omega_{E_i}$ \\) corresponding to its frequency across all snapshots. Filtering strategies can then be applied, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing the bottom 10% of hyperedges by weight \\($ \\Omega_{E_i} $\\), or  \n",
    "- Setting a threshold \\( C \\) and retaining only hyperedges with \\($ \\Omega_{E_i} > C $\\).  \n",
    "\n",
    "After filtering, the remaining interactions are aggregated into a **single static hypergraph**. The resulting hypergraph exhibits varying levels of **inter-order overlap**, which depend on both the chosen time window \\( \\Delta t \\) and the filtering threshold \\( C \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how different parameters affect the resulting higher-order structure, we apply the **maximal-clique-with-overlap method** to real-world proximity data from the **Copenhagen Network Study**. This dataset provides **high-resolution Bluetooth proximity data** among university students. -> ref: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0325-x\n",
    "\n",
    "We construct hypergraphs by varying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **time window** \\( $\\Delta t$ = \\{5, 10, 15, 30\\} \\) minutes, and  \n",
    "- The **minimum contact threshold** \\( C = \\{1, 3, 5, 10\\} \\),  \n",
    "\n",
    "and compute the corresponding **inter-order overlap matrix \\( A \\)** for each parameter combination.\n"
